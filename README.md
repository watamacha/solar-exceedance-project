# solar-exceedance-project

This repository contains working files from a math 381 project in which we were tasked with calculating exceedance probabilities for solar radiation.
Our data came from the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET). We gathered the data with a chrome extension, parsed it with python,
stored it with SQLite, and analyzed and visualized it with R.
